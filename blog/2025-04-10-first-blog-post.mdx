## What You'll Find

The purpose of these docs is mainly to provide a tutorial for how to use **[Typing Temple](https://www.typingtemple.com/)**, the smoothest site for practicing biblical typing. For some people this tutorial may not be necessary, but for others they may feel a little overwhelmed upon seeing all the starting options for typing. Not to worry! We'll get you up and running in no time!... Well, maybe 5 minutes.
