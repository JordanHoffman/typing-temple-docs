# Upon Completion

Once you finish typing your final verse, a results popup will appear. 

## If You Turned Off "WPM Results"

If you toggled the <Selectable>WPM Results</Selectable> option off, your results popup will be very simple. You can click <Selectable>Redo</Selectable> if you would like to re-type the same section again. I you would like to choose something else, just click the **close button** in the top right and you will be taken back to the starting options.

### Statistics Breakdown:

- **Total Characters Typed:** Each letter and space counts as a character. This gives the total number you typed.
- **Errors:** Your total number of errors (incorrect letters or spaces).
- **Accuracy:** The percent of characters you typed correctly.
- **Words per Minute (wpm):** Your total words typed per minute. This uses a special formula!

### WPM (Words-per-Minute) Formula:

<div className="inline-flex items-center mb-6">
	<b className="">WPM</b>
	<b className="mx-5">=</b>

	<div className="inline-flex flex-col">
		<div className="flex items-center px-3">
			<div className="flex flex-col text-center">
				<span><b>Total Words</b></span> 
				<span><i>(5 characters per word)</i></span>
			</div>
			<div className="px-3">&mdash;</div>
			<div><b>Total Errors</b></div>
		</div>
		<div className="border-1 my-2" />
		<div className="text-center px-3"><b>Total Minutes</b></div>
	</div>
</div>

:::caution
Errors will lower your WPM score. Getting 1 error counts as spelling a word wrong. In other words, it's like losing the time it took you to type 5 whole characters.
