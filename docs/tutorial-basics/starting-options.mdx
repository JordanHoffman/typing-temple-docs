# Starting Options

Before typing, you'll need to choose a few starting options. They appear at the top for desktop screens. For mobile, click the <Selectable>OPTIONS</Selectable> button to view them:

## Version

Click the <Selectable>VERSION</Selectable> dropdown to choose between **two bible versions** for typing:
1. **King James Versions (KJV)** - A classical bible published in 1611 which uses a much older form of English like what you would see in Shakespear. This can be both fun and challenging to read and type.
2. **World English Bible (WEB)** - A modern bible translation based off the American Standard Version (ASV). This allows for a more easily understandable typing experience.

## Book

Click the <Selectable>BOOK</Selectable> dropdown to choose from any book from the **Old Testament** or **New Testament** to type from.

## Chapter

After you've chosen your desired book, click the <Selectable>Chapter</Selectable> dropdown to choose any chapter from that book.

## Verse Start & Verse End

Now that you have your book and chapter chosen, you can click the <Selectable>Verse start</Selectable> dropdown to choose the verse you would like to start from. Then, click the <Selectable>Verse end</Selectable> dropdown to choose the verse you would like to finish at.

*Note: You can type as little as a single verse if you like, and you can also type an entire chapter if you're feeling up for it! To make things simpler, there's a **final** option for **Verse end** which means the same as the final verse.*

## WPM Results

You can click the <Selectable>WPM Results</Selectable> toggle-button to turn this option on or off. If it is set on, it will display your typing statistics once you finish. Keep it on to get a detailed report, or turn it off if you simply want some carefree typing. If you're curious, all results are discussed later in the **[Upon Completion](/docs/tutorial-basics/upon-completion)** section.
