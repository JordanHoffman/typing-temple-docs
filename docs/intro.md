# About

**[Typing Temple](https://www.typingtemple.com/)** is a website to practice and improve typing specifically through the bible.

## History

At one point I was interested in improving my typing speed. I searched for websites which allowed my to type biblical verses, but nearly all were rather outdated, slow, and somewhat glitchy. Thus **[Typing Temple](https://www.typingtemple.com/)** was born: a site which allows fine-grained control of typing preferences alongside a comfortable typing experience for biblical verses.

## Main Features

- Two bible versions to choose from for typing, freely available in the public domain:
	- 1\. King James Versions - A classical bible published in 1611 which uses a much older form of English like what you would see in Shakespear. This can be both fun and challenging to read and type.
	- 2\. World English Bible - A modern bible translation based off the American Standard Version (ASV). This allows for a more easily understandable typing experience.
- Ability to select any chapter from the Old Testament or New Testament to type.
- Ability to select any amount of verses within a chapter to type.
- Options to display final statistics upon completion. These statistics inlclude:
	- Total Characters typed
	- Errors
	- Accuracy
	- Words Per Minute (wpm)

## What Do I Need?

**[Typing Temple](https://www.typingtemple.com/)** was primarily made to be used on a computer/laptop with a keyboard. It is possible for it to work on tablets/phones. However, many mobile devices are incompatible as their inputs are designed to allow for entire words to be placed at once rather than going letter by letter.
